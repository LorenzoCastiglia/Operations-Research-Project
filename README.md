## Abstract

This project was a group assignment done in collaboration with my colleagues Luca Cordioli and Alessandro Di Renzo.

The task was to solve a complex Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem using the Python-MIP package.
Since it wasn't viable to find an exact solution due to the amount of parameters, the evaluation of this project took into consideration the accuracy of the approximation and the execution time.

Further details about the optimization problem and our proposed solution are found in the "notebook.ipynb" file.
